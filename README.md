# Jaiden D'Souza's SQL Portfolio
## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This is where you can find some of the SQL projects I’ve worked on while learning how to organize and analyze data. You’ll find examples of how I create tables, write queries, and explore data to find useful insights. I’ve really enjoyed building these projects and improving my skills along the way. Feel free to take a look around, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
